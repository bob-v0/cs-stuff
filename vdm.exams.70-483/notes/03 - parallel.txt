# Parallel

Parallel has a number of static methods to concurrently execute a function on every item in sequence.
Note that for small amounts of work or synchronize access to resources it can hurt performance.

	code: Parallel.For(0, 10, i => { Console.WriteLine(i); });

Is in the System.Threading.Tasks namespace.

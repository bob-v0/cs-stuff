# Tasks

Queuing a work item to a thread pool is usefull, but there is no build-in way of knowing when it is finished and what the return value is.
This is why .NET introduced the concept of Tasks, which is an object that represents some work that should be done.
The Task can tell you if the work is completed and if the operation returns a result. The Task gives the result.

A Task scheduler is responsible for starting the Task and managing it. By default, the Task Scheduler uses threads from the thread pool to execute the Task.

Tasks can be used to make your application more responsive. It makes it easy to offload work from the main UI thread.
You can also parallelize work to make use of multiple processors.

It does NOT help with scalability!
